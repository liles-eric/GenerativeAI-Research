# NOTES AND RESEARCH ON GENERATIVE AI

Welcome to the **GenerativeAI Research Notes Section**! This repository is structured to help organize research, drafts, and GPT personas, and to facilitate efficient content creation for both general audience publications and scholarly journals.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **assets/**
   This folder contains images, diagrams, and any other static resources that may be used in drafts, presentations, or notes.

### 2. **final-submissions/**
   Once drafts are finalized and ready for submission to journals or publishers, they are stored here for easy reference.

### 3. **Notes/**
   The **Notes** section contains the primary content of this workspace, organized into several subfolders:
   
   - **chat-gpt/**  
     Stores chat transcripts, ideas, and interactions related to various GPT-based projects.
   
   - **customgpts/**  
     Contains all configurations and custom persona prompts for the GPTs being developed or referenced in this research.
   
   - **transcripts/**  
     Archives of session transcripts from meetings, research discussions, or other relevant conversations.

   - **drafts/articles/**  
     This folder contains working drafts for articles, divided into categories:
     - **general-audience/**: Articles meant for blogs, magazines, or a non-specialized audience.
     - **scholarly-journals/**: Drafts of papers intended for submission to academic or peer-reviewed journals.
   
### 4. **scripts/**
   Any automation or helper scripts used for data processing, content formatting, or workspace management are stored here.

## Key Files

### 1. **README.md**
   This file. It explains the purpose of the workspace and provides an overview of its structure.

### 2. **root.md**
   This file serves as the main entry point for the workspace in Dendron. It should contain an overview of the current state of the research, ongoing projects, or links to important notes.

### 3. **root.schema.yml**
   This file defines the schema for how content is organized within the Dendron workspace, ensuring that notes are consistently categorized.

## How to Use This Workspace

1. **Research & Notes**  
   Use the **Notes** section to document research, collect transcripts, and write drafts for publication. Each note should be placed in the appropriate subfolder based on its purpose (e.g., general audience articles, scholarly articles, GPT prompts).
   
2. **Final Submissions**  
   Once a draft is finalized and ready for submission, move it to the **final-submissions** folder for easy access when submitting to journals, blogs, or conferences.
   
3. **Custom GPTs**  
   The **customgpts/** folder is where all the GPT personas and configurations are stored. These are essential for any AI-based tasks or projects being worked on.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure that all notes and drafts follow the appropriate structure defined by **root.schema.yml**.
- Before finalizing a draft, ensure that it has been thoroughly reviewed and edited.
- Add any new scripts related to data processing or research automation in the **scripts/** folder, with proper documentation.
